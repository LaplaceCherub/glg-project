      <p>We are Ying, Cody and Cris, students of <a href="https://fourthbrain.ai/">FourthBrain</a>'s Machine Learning Engineer course, cohort 9 (August-December 2022) and this is our capstone project.</p>
      <p><a href="https://glginsights.com/articles/glg-survey-most-c-suite-execs-expect-the-covid-19-recession-to-have-greater-short-term-less-long-term-impact-than-2008-recession/">GLG</a>'s business largely revolves around
        matching clients with topic experts so that they can meet by phone, video or in person.</p>
      <p>To do that a client submits a request describing the topic(s) they seek to gain expertise on and GLG in turn searches their database of 1 million experts for the right match so that the meeting can be scheduled in short
        order.</p>
      <p>Our web app uses natural language processing (NLP) to quickly retrieve the key infomation contained in each client request. These information can be further used by a recommendation model so that the matching process can be semi-automated.
      </p>
      <p>For an in-depth and technical look, we invite you to also visit our <a href="https://github.com/LaplaceCherub/glg-project">Github repository</a>.</p>
      <p>To test drive our web app, simply go to the <a href='/try'>Try it Out</a> tab and enter your own request for topic expertise.</p>
      <p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
