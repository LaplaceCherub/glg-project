        <p>We are Ying, Cody and Cris, students of FourthBrain's Machine Learning Engineer course, cohort 9 (August-December 2022) and this is our capstone project.</p>
        <p>GLG's business largely revolves around matching clients with topic experts so that they can meet by phone, video or in person.</p>
        <p>To do that a client submits a request describing the topic(s) they seek to gain expertise on and GLG in turn searches their database of 1 million experts for the right match so that the meeting can be scheduled in short order.</p>
        <p>Our web app uses natural language processing (NLP) to quickly and accurately identify the key topic(s) contained in each client request so that the matching process can be semi-automated via machine learning.</p>
        <p>For an in-depth and technical look, we invite you to also visit our Github repository.</p>
        <p>To test drive our web app, simply go to the "Try it Out" tab and enter your own request for topic expertise.</p>
        <p>Thanks for visiting.</p>
