            <p>Hey! I'm Cody McCormack. I'm a data analyst and engineer, with experience in digital marketing, product, retail and finance.</p>
            <p>As a linguistics major, and rising math master's student at Johns Hopkins, I'm very interested in machine learning's applications to language data, and how ML models can be used to better parse the vast amount of text data available on
              the web. I plan to do my master's thesis on topological data analysis, and better understand how dimensionality impacts machine lerning algorithms.</p>

            <p>Hello, my name is Ying Hu. I'm a research mathematician in the area of geometric topology. I received my Ph.D. at Louisiana State University and spent three years in Canada as a research fellow at McGill University and Université du
              Québec à Montréal. Currently, I am an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska, Omaha. </p>
            <p>In addition to pure math research, I also work on applied projects with researchers in the engineering departments. I've recently developed a keen interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I look forward to seeing
              what machines and humans together can achieve! </p>
