-------------------------------------

Context: Cris, Ying and Cody are students of FourthBrain's Machine Learning Engineer course, cohort 9 (August-December 2022). This repository (repo) is part of our capstone project, a required deliverable from our curriculum. For that we've chosen to work on the GLG project.

-------------------------------------

The problem: GLG's business largely revolves around matching clients, requesting insights on a specific topic, with an expert on that topic from their large database so that they can meet by phone, video or in person. Visually: [INSERT BELOW PICTURE OF PROCESS FLOW]


Since GLG receives 100s of these requests per day, how can they leverage machine learning to semi-automate the matching process at scale? 

-------------------------------------

The solution: 
Natural Language Processing (NLP), consisting of three steps:

Step 1:  Named-Entity Recognition (NER)
Possible libraries: spaCy, The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), TensorFlow, Keras

Step 2: Hierarchical clustering
Under consideration: decision tree, K-means clustering, Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)

*Step 3: build a recommendation system to suggest the highest matching expert(s) for each request but that is outside the scope of this project

-------------------------------------

Illustrative and simplified example: [INSERT BELOW PICTURE OF THREE AFOREMENTIONED STEPS INCLUDING INPUT/MODEL/OUTPUT SEQUENCE]

Acronyms: NLP (Natural Language Processing), NER (Named-Entity Recognition), HC (Hierarchical Clustering), 
DJ (Disc Jockey), GLG (Gerson Lehrman Group). * Step 3 is outside the scope of this project
