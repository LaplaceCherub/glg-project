<details><summary>Context</summary>
<p>

Cris, Ying and Cody are students of [FourthBrain's](https://fourthbrain.ai/) [Machine Learning Engineer course](https://fourthbrain.ai/courses/machine-learning-engineer/), cohort 9 (August-December 2022). This repository (repo) is part of our capstone project, a required deliverable from our curriculum. For that we've chosen to work on the [GLG](https://glginsights.com/) project.

<details><summary>The problem</summary>
<p>

[GLG](https://glginsights.com/)'s business largely revolves around matching clients, requesting insights on a specific topic, with an expert on that topic from their large database so that they can meet by phone, video or in person. Visually:

Since [GLG](https://glginsights.com/) receives 100s of these requests per day, how can they leverage machine learning to semi-automate the matching process at scale?

<details><summary>The solution</summary>
<p>
  
Natural Language Processing (NLP), consisting of three steps:

- Step 1:  Named-Entity Recognition (NER)
  
Selected libraries: spaCy, The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

- Step 2: Clustering
  
Topic modeling: latent Dirichlet allocation or LDA (being tested, promising)
  
K-means clustering (current results disappointing; to be tested using better embedding algorithm)

- Step 3*: build a recommendation system to suggest the highest matching expert(s) for each request

<details><summary>Deployment Instructions</summary>
<p>This app can be (relatiely, see note below) easily deployed using Docker. The instructions to deploy in the cloud or locally are the same.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Clone this repository, either on a local machine or in a cloud instance</li>
  <li>Navigate to the flask_app folder</li>
  <li>Build the Docker image, using the command <code>docker build -t image_name .</code></li>
    <ul>
      <li>If you don't have Docker installed locally or in the cloud instance, you will have to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">install</a> and activate the Daemon in order to build a Docker image.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
