<details><summary>Context</summary>
<p>

Ying, Cody and Cris are students of [FourthBrain's](https://fourthbrain.ai/) [Machine Learning Engineer course](https://fourthbrain.ai/courses/machine-learning-engineer/), cohort 9 (August-December 2022). This repository (repo) is part of our capstone project, a required deliverable from our curriculum. For that we've chosen to work on the [GLG](https://glginsights.com/) project.

<details><summary>The problem</summary>
<p>

[GLG](https://glginsights.com/)'s business largely revolves around matching clients, requesting insights on a specific topic, with an expert on that topic from their large database so that they can meet by phone, video or in person. Visually:

Since [GLG](https://glginsights.com/) receives 100s of these requests per day, how can they leverage machine learning to semi-automate the matching process at scale?

<details><summary>Conclusions</summary>
<p>

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) models work!

- Any NLP model is only as good as the data it was trained on

- Quickly jumping into the web app (Flask), even before the NLP models were working properly, was the right thing to do (MVP mindset)

- Seeing a live, working, deployed model that addresses a real business problem is priceless 

  
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Future work</summary>
<p>

- Training our NLP models on larger and more diverse datasets should yield better results. For example, using this other 2.7-million news articles dataset: [All the News 2.0 - Components](https://components.one/datasets/all-the-news-2-news-articles-dataset/)

- Adapting our models to cover non-English languages would come in handy (GLG also has offices in Europe, Asia, Japan and the Middle East)

- Building a GLG topic expert(s) recommendation model with input from our NLP models would be a natural next step for this project
